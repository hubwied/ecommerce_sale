# Project Overview
This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data. The goal is to identify top-selling products, seasonal trends, popular categories, and customer locations. The analysis includes basic statistics, correlation checks, and data visualizations to gain actionable insights.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **pandas**:
  - Handling missing values and duplicates
  - Creating new columns (`total_sales`, `year`, `month`, `day_of_week`)
- Sales analysis:
  - Top 10 products by total sales
  - Sales by category
  - Monthly and weekly sales trends
  - Top customer locations
- Correlation analysis between numeric variables
- Data visualization using **matplotlib**:
  - Bar charts, pie charts, and line plots

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Example Insights
- Highest sales occur during specific months or categories
- Most purchased products may vary depending on the season
- Weak correlation between price and quantity, suggesting stable demand
- Customer locations influence overall sales performance
